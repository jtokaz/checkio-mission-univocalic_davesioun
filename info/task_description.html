<p>
    Write a function named <b>"davesioun"</b> (division with vowels a,e,i,o,u) which calculates floating point division by 10.
    Aside from the function name itself, you are allowed only one vowel in <b>"aeiou"</b>.  You may use this vowel
    multiple times.  The slash <b>"/"</b> and asterisk <b>"*"</b> are also disallowed.

    We have one more rule for this challenge. This is a code golf mission and your main goal is to make your code as
    short as possible. The shorter your code, the more points you earn. Your score for this mission is dynamic and
    directly related to the length of your code. For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used. 100
    characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points. For each character less than 100, you earn 1
    point. For example for 30 character long code earns you 70 points.
