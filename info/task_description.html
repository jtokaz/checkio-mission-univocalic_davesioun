<p>
    Write a function named <b>"dvsn"</b> (division without vowels) which calculates floating point division by 10.
    The slash <b>"/"</b> and asterisk <b>"*"</b> are disallowed.

    We have one more rule for this challenge. This is a code golf mission and your main goal is to make your code as
    short as possible. The shorter your code, the more points you earn. Your score for this mission is dynamic and
    directly related to the length of your code. For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used. 100
    characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.  For each character less than 100, you earn 1
    point.  <b>Additionally, you are penalized 10 points for each distinct vowel in "aeiou."</b>  There is no additional
    penalty for repeated use of a vowel.  For example code 30 characters long utilizing two vowels earns you 100-30-20=50 points.
